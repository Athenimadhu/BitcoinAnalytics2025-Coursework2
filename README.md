# Bitcoin Analytics for Coursework 2: Impact of Global Events (2017–2025)
This repository contains all materials for Coursework 2 of the Practical Data Analytics module. It analyzes how three global events, COVID-19 (March–December 2020), the Russia-Ukraine conflict (February–June 2022), and the 2025 Trump tariffs (February–April 2025) affected Bitcoin’s price, volatility, and trading volume. 

# Project Overview
The project uses the Binance BTC/USDT daily dataset (2017–2025) to study Bitcoin’s response to global events. Key objectives:
- Quantify price, volatility, and volume changes during specific periods (e.g., March 12, 2020 crash).
- Visualize trends, returns, and volatility using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
- Perform t-tests and ARIMA(5,1,0) forecasting for June 2025.
- Provide business decisions (e.g., hedging in 2022) and policy recommendations (e.g., 2025 regulations).
